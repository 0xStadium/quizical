# Quizical

Quizical is an application for students who need digital flashcards to study off of. I developed Quizical to learn the Node, Express, MongoDB, and EJS stack.

## Approach

* Started by creating user stories and breaking down the problem into smaller parts
* MongoDB, EJS, Node, and Express were all new to me when developing this project, so I've made some bad practices.
  The biggest offender is not implementing a Model View Controller framework to make the code more readable.
